# Temperature-Time-Series-Analysis
Here I perform an exploratory analysis of temperature time series data from 1970-2013 and discuss how to determine if the time series is stationary or not using the Dickey-Fuller Test. I then dive into a few ways that you can make a time series stationary and how to determine the parameters for SARIMA.
